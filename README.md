Just walked outta Mountainhead—my god. Eyes still adjusting from the dark, sounds bouncing around my skull like leftover thunderclaps. You know that jarring sensation after a rollercoaster? Like suddenly you’re on solid ground but your brain’s convinced you're still looping. Theater was freezing, like they want you to feel the mountain’s chill. Spilled popcorn box mid-scene, third time this week… no one ever talks about how popcorn feels like pebbles when it gets stuck in the wrong spot. 

The movie, man… it’s like a fever dream painted on the back of your eyelids, right? Wasn’t even about the plot so much as it was the feeling—endless, yawning vertigo on the precipice of something greater. The protagonists—their relationship was jagged like old carvings on a desk. Can’t recall their names right now, that's how they blend into the damn landscape. Mountains-carr-carry those memories—sounds corny but where do thoughts go when they greet the horizon? 

> Oh, remember how the sound was so loud you could feel it buzz through your bones, like being underwater? Those echoes in the caverns and the beating of a heart somewhere—it was the rhythm of a restless planet, a lullaby for insomnia. Someone said download the movie earlier… gotta find a site or something brb.

And those scenes, transitions like torn pages from a disjointed novel. You don't just watch the movie; you survive it, endure its quiet fury. Back aches—this chair, or maybe it was when we slipped on the icy sidewalk outside. Silly of me to wear those thin sneakers in October. Wow, it smelled like butter and nostalgia in there—or maybe that’s just old places clinging to your clothes.

Been told to watch the movie again, but it feels too soon. Like seeing a cracked mirror; do you fixate on your own reflection or the splintered glass?

Anyway, gotta run. Feels like there’s still snow in my hair. Here, this might mean somethin' to someone, random code mishap from another world:
// potatoFunction() {
alert(“mistyped key event”;
var x = peanutButter;
}
